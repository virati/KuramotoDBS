    "### Alpha synchronization or non-Alpha desychronization?\n",
    "$\\theta_\\alpha$ activity has been found to be inversely related to inputs into a brain region, suggesting that increased measurement of $\\theta_\\alpha$ power reflects reduced computation and increased *idling* of a brain region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increases in $\\theta_\\alpha$ across multiple brain regions can be described as synchronization if only MS-coherence is studied. However, if the phases are offset, then a complete disconnection of the network can appear to be an increase in $\\theta_\\alpha$ MS-coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest alternative language. If $\\theta_\\alpha$ power increases amongst regions then this may reflect a desynchronization between regions."
