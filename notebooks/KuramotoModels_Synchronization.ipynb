    "\n",
    "Increases in $\\theta_\\alpha$ across multiple brain regions can be described as synchronization if only MS-coherence is studied. However, if the phases are offset, then a complete disconnection of the network can appear to be an increase in $\\theta_\\alpha$ MS-coherence.\n",

    "We suggest alternative language. If $\\theta_\\alpha$ power increases amongst regions then this may reflect a desynchronization between regions."
