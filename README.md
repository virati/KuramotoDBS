Kuramoto Modeling of Uncinate Circuit

## Introduction

The core modeling work win the Kuramoto approach of our uncinate circuit. Meant to be a very simple, DTI informed approach to modeling DBS mechanism and doing hypothesis testing in the context of human subject electrophysiology.


## Prior work
A lot of this was directly enabled by work from Rohit Konda. Check out some of the earlier notebooks that the work in this repo is built off of [here](https://github.com/rohit-konda/KuramotoDBS)
