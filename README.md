# Kuramoto Model of SCCwm-DBS
Kuramoto Modeling of SCCwm-DBS across uncinate circuit.

## Introduction

The core modeling work win the Kuramoto approach of our uncinate circuit. Meant to be a very simple, DTI informed approach to modeling DBS mechanism and doing hypothesis testing in the context of human subject electrophysiology.


## Prior work
A lot of this was directly enabled by work from Rohit Konda. Check out some of the earlier notebooks that the work in this repo is built off of [here](https://github.com/rohit-konda/KuramotoDBS)

## Uncinate Circuit
Early version of the modeled uncinate circuit looked like:


Current version looks similar, with additional placeholder nodes for known connected regions - though no measurements are available in the "Reverse Engineering SCCwm-DBS" Project.

## Hypotheses
$H_0:$ the null is simple - DBS does nothing to anything in the circuit. Any apparent changes are just noise.
$H_1:$ the chronologically first hypothesis was that therapeutic DBS blocked communication between the frontal and temporal, via the uncinate fasciculus bilaterally.
$H_2:$ a later hypothesis, more supported by tractography, is that the right cingulum bundle is modulated by DBS.
$H_3+:$ other hypotheses can be constructed by combinations of all possibilities - these are less likely given other results and information.
